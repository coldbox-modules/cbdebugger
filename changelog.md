## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New `HyperCollector` so you can now track hyper requests if enabled
- `Timer` can now add timers a-la-carte via the `add()` method
- `TimerDelegate` now has a `addCBTimer()` method
- New fast and furious and tiny SQL/JSON Formatter
- New `LuceeSqlCollector` you can use to profile all SQL calls in Lucee
- New `luceeSql` configuration to control the Lucee SQL calls collector
- Changed the `instance` argument to `any` in the `debuggerService.openInEditorURL` to allow for a flat representational string of the URL to open in the editor.
- Ability to download a heap dump snapshot from the visualizer

### Changed

- The request panel dock is now a real dock and the only one presented, the rest are only show in the visualizer
- The `requestTracker.expanded` option is now removed, it's always expanded for visualizer and contracted for the dock

### Improved

- Updated test harness UI to make it easier to create debugging events

### Fixed

- Dumb whitespace added by CFML engines when doing inline `<pre>#method()#</pre>` calls.
- Better error handling when Debugger assets are not compiled instead of a cryptic error message:
`The parameter [str] to function [closure_m] is required but was not passed in.`

## [4.1.0] - 2023-04-17

### Added

- New github actions
- Donot enable debugger in testing mode

## [4.0.1] => 2022-NOV-22

### Fixed

- Adobe dumb array by value

## [4.0.0] => 2022-NOV-22

### Added

- ColdBox 7 support
- New `TimerDelegate` that can be used to add timer functions to any model:
  - `startCBTimer()`
  - `stopCBTimer()`
  - `cbTimeIt()`
  - `addCBTimer()`
- Timer service rewritten to support nesting and included metadata
- Ability to open views and layouts from the execution timers in any Code Editor
- New `WireBoxCollector` which is only used if enabled.  This greatly accelerates the performance of the request collector since before they where in the same collector.
- Ability to open CFCs that are profiled by the WireBox Collector in any Code Editor.
- Ability to open the Handler events that are profiled by the Request Collector in any Code Editor.
- New life-cycle events: `onDebuggerUnload`, `onDebuggerLoad`
- Ability for the custom `timeIt()` functions to accept metdata to store in the execution timer
- New `Slowest` Queries panel for cborm, acf, and qb/quick
- New visualizer total db time as well as request time including percentage of the request time
- Ability to export a profiler in json
- Ability to sort the visualizer's profilers

### Fixed

- Timer service reconstructing the timer hashes and profilers twice.
- `timeIt()` helper was not passing the closure correctly
- If doing a fwreinit on the visualizer, the current profiler was still being show even thought it was empty.  Add an empty check to avoid the big bang!
- Empty response codes for Adobe, due to their incredibly weird Response object nesting.
- Migration to java random id's for speed

### Changed

- Tracers are now streamlined and stored alongside the request profilers
- Small UI fixes on request profiler HTTP methods
- WireBox collecting is now done by the WireBox collector not the Request Collector.
- Adobe 2016 Dropped

## [3.4.1] => 2022-JUL-12

### Fixed

- If the debugger is disabled or not in debug mode, the panels and visualizers are still being rendered and exploding. This should be a 404.

## [3.4.0] => 2022-JUN-27

### Added

- Upgraded entire front end build process to ColdBox Elixir v4
- Upgraded to Node 16 for all front end processes

### Fixed

- If the cbdebugger was embedded within an app already using Alpine, it will fail. Now it will leach on to the running Alpine app.

## [3.3.2] => 2022-MAY-02

### Fixed

- [CBDEBUGGER-19](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/CBDEBUGGER-19) - JSON Form serialization not working on formatting.

## [3.3.1] => 2022-APR-21

### Fixed

- [CBDEBUGGER-17](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/CBDEBUGGER-17) If you change the monitor frequency, it does not clear the old monitor and you get n monitors
- [CBDEBUGGER-16](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/CBDEBUGGER-16) Left double hash on no state for request tracker profiler
- [CBDEBUGGER-15](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/CBDEBUGGER-15) Auto-Refresh is not working in latest version
- [CBDEBUGGER-10](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/CBDEBUGGER-10) Executing Event That Uses QB From Interceptor Generates CBDebugger Exception
- [CBDEBUGGER-6](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/CBDEBUGGER-6) Stop auto-refresh when visiting a actual request report

## [3.3.0] => 2022-APR-21

### Added

- Asynchronous saving of storage at end of requests
- Asynchronous size checks of storage
- Free memory diff in the visualizers
- Ability for each profiler to track how much memory they used during the course of the transaction by analyzing free memory
- New setting `requestPanelDock` to show/hide the request panel in the dock
- Migration to use new module template approaches that supports github releases, compilation and more
- Exception bean delegations in debugger service to avoid multi-instantiations `performance`
- Refactoring to increase `performance` and reusability
- Migration to AlpineJS from jquery
- New `sqlformatter` module from @michaelborn
- Updated to faster wasy to get a local ip and local hostname

### Fixed

- Actually show a 404 if debug mode is off
- JS Bumps

### Removed

- Reload all modules. Makes no sense as you can just reinit.

## [3.2.0] => 2021-JUL-21

### Changed

- Thanks to @homestar9 changed the elixir asset to a specific of `cbdebugger.(js.css)` to avoid collisions with main app.

### Added

- Adobe 2021 support and automated testing
- Migration to github actions

## [3.1.1] => 2021-JUN-05

### Fixed

- Do not render when the request's content type is NOT html

## [3.1.0] => 2021-MAy-19

### Fixed

- Fix wrong cborm reference on QBCollector
- Look at the renderdata content type instead of type as it's more consistent in order to turn off the debugger on multi-marshalled sites
- [CBDEBUGGER-1] - Lucee debugger no longer shows below the cbDebugger. Turn off only on Ajax Calls

### Changed

- Use Java property for version to work with jdk8+
- [CBDEBUGGER-2] - Made `cborm` and `qb` disabled by default

## [3.0.0] => 2021-APR-07

### Added

- Completely rewritten debugger
- Updated tracers to match all logbox options so we can use them for display instead of hardcoding them in the push operation
- Complete migration to elixir for assets
- Complete migration to runnable events to make things easier for rendering and debugging
- New interceptor profiling via AOP `announce` interceptions
- New object profiling via metadata AOP aspects via new settings: `profileObjects`, `traceObjectResults`
- New visualizer route `/cbdebugger` that if you are in debug mode, you can visualize the panels. Great for API apps
- New method: `timer.timeIt()` so you can time code execution via a closure wrapper
- New Helper Methods: `startCBTimer(), stopCBTimer(), cbTimeIt()`
- Added the route record to the info panel so you can debug the selected route
- Highlights transactions that take over `200ms` or using the `slowExecutionThreshold` setting
- Refactored to use array of structs instead of queries for even faster timer performance

### Changed

- Encapsualted request timers UI into a single template
- `Timer` is now built in script and optimized
- Show timers as they start instead of how they end, huge UI update to visualize the timers
- Refactored the logbox appenders from `includes/appenders` to `appenders`

### Security

- `Dumpar` facilities removed due to security concerns

### Removed

- Old `debugger` settings instead use the `modulesettings.cbdebugger` according to ColdBox 5+ standards
- Old helper code to remove helpers
- Removed the loaded modules as it just produced noise
- Removed the rc/prc snapshot comparisons, causes too much noise and not helpful anymore
